# Tenzies Game by Scrimba ft FreeCodeCamp!

## Introduction

Welcome to my Tenzies game project! This project was developed as part of my journey learning React. I've recently completed a comprehensive React course and this game is a testament to the skills and concepts I've acquired.

## New Features

I'm currently in the process of adding new features to make the game even more interesting. These enhancements not only improve the game but also provide me with an opportunity to further practice and refine my React skills. 

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

```bash
1. Clone the repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/Alvarosig/tenzies-game.git
$ cd tenzies-game

2. Install the dependencies:
$ npm install # or yarn  

3. Start the development server:
$ npm run dev # or yarn run dev 

Now, you should be able to see the project running on your local machine. Enjoy playing Tenzies!
